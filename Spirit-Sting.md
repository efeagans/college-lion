# Lance's Hockey Journey: From Spirit to Sting

## The Early Years: Discovering the Ice

Lance's journey in this sport began when he was still in diapers and around the age of 3.  He would set up [Shinny Hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinny) as I sat to watch the St. Louis Blues play on television.  I believe the rabidness of my fandom to St. Louis Blues hockey definitely sparked his interest at a young age.  Around the age of five we sought out opportunities to get Lance on the ice, in skates, and really give hockey a try.  Through the [St. Peters Hockey Club](https://www.stpetershockey.com/) we discovered a program called "Learn to Play".  This turned out to be the spring board into his [hockey](https://github.com/efeagans/college-lion/blob/main/Little%20Lance.JPG) (cool photograph, you should check it out!) pursuit.

## Growing with the Game

Following "Learn to Play" the next step was signing Lance up to play hockey on a team.  Much like the classic movie ["Mighty Ducks"](https://github.com/efeagans/college-lion/blob/main/mighty%20ducks.jpg), hockey is regionalized, and the team you play on is determined by the address where you live.  This keeps programs from recruiting the best players and tilting the competitive scale in their favor.  Due to this rule, Lance was to play for the St. Peters Hockey Club based out of the Rec-Plex in St. Peters, MO.  At the ripe age of 6 Lance was ready to play, and was placed on his first team.  Like most sports, hockey is separated by age.  The groups are 6U, 8U, 10U (Squirt), 12U (Pee Wee), 14U (Bantam), 16U (Midget), and 18U (Midget Major).  Youth hockey has different set ups for different ages as well, this keeps the players challenged and learning as they progress.  This is structured through [USA Hockey's American Developmental Model](https://github.com/efeagans/college-lion/blob/main/ADM.pdf) (ADM). Here is a summary of their goals:  The American Developmental Model (ADM) details the development and implementation of the American Development Model (ADM) by USA Hockey. Recognizing the gap between the scientific understanding of athlete development and the reality of youth hockey practices, USA Hockey embarked on a research-driven initiative to improve the sport nationwide. The ADM, based on principles of Long-Term Athlete Development (LTAD), emphasizes age-appropriate training, skill development, and a focus on process over outcome. Key elements of the ADM include cross-ice play for 8U players, station-based practice structures, and a games-based learning environment. The ADM aims to create a more engaging and effective player development system that fosters a love for the sport and maximizes player potential.

## The Club Hockey Experience

Club hockey teams play a significant role in a young player's development. These organizations often provide a more competitive environment, allowing players to test their skills against top talent from other areas.  Lance's journey with the St. Louis Sting Hockey Club began six years ago when he was just 10 years old. Competing in the Central States Developmental Hockey League, the club has played a crucial role in his development as a player. His team follows a rigorous schedule, practicing three times a week on the ice and training in the gym twice weekly. With a demanding season that includes upwards of 50 games, Lance has honed his skills through consistent effort and dedication to both his physical conditioning and hockey techniques. The commitment required for club hockey – including travel, additional practice time, and off-ice training – helps instill discipline and time management skills that benefit players in all aspects of life.  Lance's team has had many successes through the years winning National Tournaments in [Chicago](https://github.com/efeagans/college-lion/blob/main/Chicago.jpg), [Detroit](https://github.com/efeagans/college-lion/blob/main/Detroit.JPG), [Nashville](https://github.com/efeagans/college-lion/blob/main/Nashville.jpg), [Dallas](https://github.com/efeagans/college-lion/blob/main/Dallas.jpg), and [Grand Rapids](https://github.com/efeagans/college-lion/blob/main/Western%20Michigan.JPG).  Club hockey has taken Lance from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Sarnia, Ontario Canada, and from Providence, Rhode Island to Phoenix, Arizona.  The memories and friendships in these travels will be with [Lance](https://youtu.be/UoMB7OgBmv8) for the rest of his life.

Club hockey also provides Lance with an opportunity to compete for a spot on the [United States National Development Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Hockey_National_Team_Development_Program).  This is the team that competes for World Championships and Olympic medals under the colors of the United States of America.  The selection process for our area starts during a tournament called "Central Districts", which generally takes place at the Ice Zone in Hazelwood, MO.  Though the chances are slim to make a USA roster, this tournament is important as it is also heavily scouted for NCAA, AAA, and Junior Professional.  It provides Lance an opportunity to showcase in front of an audience he would not normally get, and hope to move on to the next level of NCAA hockey.  

During the course of Lance's travels, he has been lucky enough to meet tons of current and past [NHL stars](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGRI-8z48U/HEThL8O8f6JvgOg_orx7VQ/view?utm_content=DAGRI-8z48U&utm_campaign=share_your_design&utm_medium=link&utm_source=shareyourdesignpanel).  Many of which have children playing the sport, and take time to coach and skate with the youth in the game.  This will be another portion of his youth sport that he tells his grandchildren about someday.  One of the most important relationships with a former NHL player for Lance, was the friendship he developed with [John Wensink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wensink).  Played in the NHL for many seasons, almost won a Stanley Cup with the Boston Bruins, and now coaches youth hockey in St. Charles, MO.  Wensink was a [coach](https://github.com/efeagans/college-lion/blob/main/Coach%20Wensink.JPG) of Lance's for a season, and we all remain friends with his family today.  His connection to the game is unmatched, his friendship is invaluable, and he is one of the many things Lance, and my family, can thank the game of hockey for the introduction.

## High School Hockey: A New Chapter

For many young players, joining their [high school](https://www.desmethockey.org.app.crossbar.org/) team marks an important milestone. High school hockey combines the pride of representing one's school with the opportunity to play alongside classmates and friends. This experience often creates a special bond among teammates and can be a highlight of a player's youth hockey career.  For Lance, this chapter has taken place at DeSmet Jesuit High School.  DeSmet Jesuit High School is a private, all-male Catholic high school located in Creve Coeur, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. The school was founded in 1967 by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) and is named after [Father Pierre-Jean De Smet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Jean_De_Smet), a 19th-century Jesuit missionary. DeSmet has established a strong reputation for academic excellence and athletic achievement over its decades of operation.

The hockey program at DeSmet Jesuit High School has been a notable part of the school's athletic offerings for many years. Ice hockey has a strong tradition in the St. Louis area, and DeSmet has contributed significantly to that legacy. The Spartans, as DeSmet's teams are known, have competed at high levels in Missouri high school hockey, often facing off against other strong programs in the area such as Christian Brothers College (CBC), St. John Vianney High School, and SLUH High School. DeSmet's 40 seasons of hockey have produced 33 Final Four appearances and 17 Missouri State Championships, which inlcudes 2023 and 2024 back to back championships.

## The Impact of Youth Hockey

Youth hockey is about more than just wins and losses. It teaches valuable life lessons such as perseverance, sportsmanship, and the value of hard work. Players learn to handle both success and disappointment, developing resilience that serves them well beyond their years on the ice.

## Community and Family Involvement

Youth hockey is a community effort, involving not just the players but also their [families](https://poe.com/chat/3jmluzn5k3glkbjshvn), coaches, and local supporters. Parents often become integral parts of the hockey community, volunteering their time, cheering from the stands, and forming lasting friendships with other hockey families.

## Looking to the Future

As young players progress through their youth hockey years, they not only develop as athletes but also as individuals. Whether their future includes college hockey, professional aspirations, or simply a lifelong love for the sport, the experiences gained through youth hockey provide a strong foundation for whatever path they choose to follow.
